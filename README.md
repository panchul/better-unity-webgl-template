[Unity's doc page on WebGL Templates](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-templates.html) is rather straight-forward, but
the template does not have the full-window mode. Thanks to the author of the repo from which I forked, the neat index
and styles work as they are supposed to.
The subfolders are the branch names. There could be useful troubleshooting workarounds, I did not have the time to look
closer at them and try in different platrofms/browsers. Updated the Unity Editors versions and everything works well.
